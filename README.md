## Overview
### The challenge

I must program a webpage whereby the users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size (max-width => 500px)
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Links

## My Progress
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vector Graphics (SVG)

### What I learnt

Since this is my first time designing a webpage with a device-first aproach, this helps make the webpage look evenly attractive and readable on both mobile and desktop size

- [x] I lerant that when i use a form-based element i must include all relevant attributes

- [x] In the footer when i should include information or links to the website's information and contact details with its social links

- [x] for `<a>` elements it is important to include the `` attribute

- [x] To make the icons colors switch roles where black is white and vice versa

I use the `filter` property whereby:  `.icon{filter: brghtness(0) invert(1)}`

```
img{
  max-inline-size: 100%
}
```
This ensures that the image does not overflow on viewport width when `writing-mode` => horizontal

### Continued development

1. On future projects, I plan on continuing to build webpages or websites starting from the mobile-screen size then to bigger screens, as it makes the content much more appealing on devices also on larger screens as well

2. Typography is another important part of a webpage or website, as it is what users will pay more attention to. So applying responsiveness to Typography as well is important (line-height, font-size, font)

  - I have seen that using CSS Functions for this makes it much easier to control the view of my text 
  - calc(x + y) / calc(x - y) => readjusts size of property as screen gows or decreases
  - clamp(x, v, y) => sets limits to the growth and shrinkage of property

One other thing i have noticed it is quite important to use relative css units for typography (vw, vh, rem) as it contributes to responsiveness designing
