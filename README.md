## Overview
### The challenge

I must program a webpage whereby the users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size (max-width => 500px)
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Links

## My Progress
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vector Graphics (SVG)

### What I learnt

Since this is my first time designing a webpage with a device-first aproach, this helps make the webpage look evenly attractive and readable on both mobile and desktop size

- [x] I lerant that when i use a form-based element i must include all relevant attributes

- [x] In the footer when i should include information or links to the website's information and contact details with its social links

- [x] for `<a>` elements it is important to include the `` attribute

- [x] To make the icons colors switch roles where black is white and vice versa

I use the `filter` property whereby:  `.icon{filter: brghtness(0) invert(1)}`

```
img{
  max-inline-size: 100%
}
```
This ensures that the image does not overflow on viewport width when `writing-mode` => horizontal

### Continued development

On future projects, I plan on continuing to build webpages or websites starting from the mobile view then to desktop, as it makes the content much more appealing on devices also in laptop as well

### Useful resources
